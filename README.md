# Face Mask Detection using CNN (End-to-End Pipeline)

##  Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end Face Mask Detection system using a CNN-based object detection approach.  
The system detects whether a person is:
- Wearing a mask correctly
- Not wearing a mask
- Wearing a mask incorrectly

The solution is designed for smart surveillance use cases such as airports, malls, and public areas.
